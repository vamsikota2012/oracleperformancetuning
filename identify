How to identify long running queries.

	1) Using oracle database data dictionary views.

• V$SESSION: Provides information about the currently active sessions in the database.
• V$SQL: Contains information about SQL statements in the shared pool.

SELECT
    s.sid,
    s.serial#,
    s.username,
    s.status,
    s.sql_id,
    s.last_call_et,
    q.sql_text
FROM
    v$session s
JOIN
    v$sql q ON s.sql_id = q.sql_id
WHERE
    s.status = 'ACTIVE'
    AND s.last_call_et > 600  -- Queries running longer than 10 minutes
ORDER BY
    s.last_call_et DESC;


	2) V$session_longops - V$SESSION_LONGOPS: Provides information about long operations (e.g., full table scans, index creation).

SELECT
    sid,
    serial#,
    opname,
    start_time,
    sofar,
    totalwork,
    (sofar/totalwork)*100 AS pct_complete
FROM
    v$session_longops
WHERE
    totalwork > 0
    AND opname NOT LIKE 'INDEX%'
ORDER BY
    start_time;

	3) OEM performacne pages.
	4) AWR reports - AWR captures database performance data over time. You can generate an AWR report to analyze SQL performance and identify long-running queries.
	5) Using SQL Trace and TKPROF
	6) SQL Trace: Enable SQL tracing for specific sessions or the entire database to capture detailed execution information.
-- Enable SQL Trace for a specific session
ALTER SESSION SET sql_trace = TRUE;

-- After running your queries, disable SQL Trace
ALTER SESSION SET sql_trace = FALSE;


TKPROF: Use TKPROF to format the trace file and analyze the performance of SQL statements.

SQL Monitoring: For queries running in real-time, you can use the V$SQL_MONITOR view to track their progress.

SELECT
    sql_id,
    sql_text,
    status,
    elapsed_time,
    cpu_time,
    buffer_gets,
    disk_reads,
    rows_processed
FROM
    v$sql_monitor
WHERE
    status = 'EXECUTING'
ORDER BY
    elapsed_time DESC;

6. Using SQL Performance Analyzer
	• SQL Performance Analyzer (SPA): Part of Oracle’s SQL Tuning Suite, it helps in assessing SQL performance and detecting long-running queries.
7. Using Oracle’s DBMS_XPLAN Package

	• DBMS_XPLAN: Use this package to get execution plans of running queries, which can provide insights into why a query is running long.

SELECT * FROM TABLE(DBMS_XPLAN.DISPLAY_CURSOR(NULL, NULL, 'ALLSTATS LAST'));
